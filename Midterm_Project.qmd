# Introduction

The goal of this data analysis is to examine if/how monetary resources
relate to the burden of drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) across
countries. Multi-Drug Resistance in any disease, is a cause for grave
concern from a public health perspective. The selection of
drug-resistant TB strains, typically due to the accumulation of
mutations in the bacteria as a result of therapy
mismanagement/non-adherence or poor drug quality, impacts all TB
patients, but may especially impact those from low-income countries,
whose access to high-quality, timely healthcare may be limited. If there
exists some correlation between healthcare capita and drug resistance,
it may indicate a requirement for countries with high incidence of
multi-drug resistant TB to increase their healthcare investment/seek aid
as necessary.

So, the primary question is:

> **Is there a relationship between a country's monetary power and the
> burden of MDR-TB?**

For this analysis, multiple datasets have been merged using common
columns or keys, and the unfortunate result of having multiple datasets
collected by different institutions (in this case, WHO and World Bank),
is that some datasets are more expansive than others. To standardize the
analysis, only the data from 2017-2023 (which is reported in all
datasets) is considered.

The datasets used are:

1.  From the World Health Organization
    1.  TB Burden Per Year Per Country

    2.  MDR TB Burden Per Year Per Country (WHO treats rifampicin
        resistance and multi-drug resistance the same)

    3.  Drug-Resistance Testing (DST) Coverage Per Country Per Year

    4.  Data Dictionary for all the above datasets
2.  From the World Bank
    1.  GDP per Capita (Country-Year)
    2.  Health Expenditure per Capita (Country-Year)

## **Reading in, Wrangling and Describing the Data**

```{r}
# Libraries 
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(readr))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(dplyr))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyr))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(knitr))

# The output of this code is a table describing the variable and the data it 
# contains (including some summary statistics like min and max). To protect 
# from trying to assess non-numerical variables as numbers, we can return NA 
# whenever a numerical operation is attempted on them. This is to ensure our 
# output is clean. 

foolproof_min <- function(x) if (is.numeric(x)) 
  suppressWarnings(min(x, na.rm = TRUE)) else NA 
foolproof_max <- function(x) if (is.numeric(x)) 
  suppressWarnings(max(x, na.rm = TRUE)) else NA 

# Reading in the data. I renamed the input files for clarity. 
gdp_pc <- read_csv("GDP_Per_Capita.csv", show_col_types = FALSE, 
                   na = c("", "NA", ".."))
health_pc <- read_csv("Healthcare_Per_Capita.csv", show_col_types = FALSE, 
                      na = c("", "NA", ".."))
mdr_burden <- read_csv("MDR_TB_Burden_Country.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)
tb_burden <- read_csv("TB_Burden_Country.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)
mdr_ds <- read_csv("TB_DR_Surveillance.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)
dict <- read_csv("TB_Data_Dictionary.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)

# Changing the World Bank Data to Long Format 
# View(gdp_pc)
# View(health_pc)
# A quick look at the data shows me that the years are arranged as one column 
# per year, which is not very useful for downstream analyses. The data is also 
# available from 1960-2025, which is far too many datapoints. So, I decided to 
# pivot the data and restrict to 2017-2023. 

gdp <- gdp_pc %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = matches("^\\d{4}$"), names_to = "year", 
               values_to = "GDPpc") %>%
  mutate(year = as.integer(year)) %>%
  rename(iso3 = 'Country Code') %>%
  filter(year >= 2017, year <= 2023) %>%
  select(iso3, year, GDPpc, Country = 'Country Name')

health <- health_pc %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = matches("^\\d{4}$"), names_to = "year", 
               values_to = "Healthpc") %>%
  mutate(year = as.integer(year)) %>%
  rename(iso3 = 'Country Code') %>%
  filter(year >= 2017, year <= 2023) %>%
  select(iso3, year, Healthpc, Country = 'Country Name')

# View(gdp)
# View(health) 
# The data is now in long format. There are 7 rows per country, 
# each row corresponding to one year 2017 to 2023

# Now restricting the WHO data to 2017-2023 
mdr <- mdr_burden %>%
  mutate(year = as.integer(year)) %>%
  filter(year >= 2017, year <= 2023)

tb <- tb_burden %>%
  mutate(year = as.integer(year)) %>%
  filter(year >= 2017, year <= 2023)

ds <- mdr_ds %>%
  mutate(year = as.integer(year)) %>%
  filter(year >= 2017, year <= 2023)
```

Now stepping through the initial steps of EDA, first checking the data
size after restricting to 2017-2023.

```{r}
library(kableExtra)

# I'm using knitr and the kableExtra package to print the dimensions of my 
# datasets
dimensions <- tibble::tibble(Dataset = c("GDP Per Capita", 
                                         "Healthcare Per Capita", 
                                         "MDR TB Burden", "TB Burden", 
                                         "TB DR Surveillance"), 
                             Number_of_Rows = c(nrow(gdp), nrow(health), 
                                                nrow(mdr), nrow(tb), nrow(ds)), 
                             Number_of_Columns = c(ncol(gdp), ncol(health), 
                                                   ncol(mdr), ncol(tb), 
                                                   ncol(ds)) )

kable(dimensions, caption = "Dimensions of Datasets Used") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = FALSE)
```

This table sumarises the scope of each source, after restricting to
2017-2023. The WHO burden and surveillance files each contain about 1500
country-years with dozens of variables, the world bank files contribute
one row per country-year for GDP and health expenditure. Together the
coverage is broad enough for the kind of global comparison I am trying
to run.

Next, to succinctly summarise the variables and their types, as well as
some summary statistics of each variable-

```{r}
# For this part, my aim is, for each dataset, produce a table documenting 
# variable name, definition (picked up from the data dictionary), data type, 
# min/max, number of NA values

# Instead of writing the same set of code over and over for each dataset, 
# I decided to write a function. 

variables <- function(dat, dict) {
  types <- sapply(dat, function(x) paste(class(x), collapse = ","))
  navals <- sapply(dat, function(x) sum(is.na(x))) 
  mins <- sapply(dat, foolproof_min)
  maxs <- sapply(dat, foolproof_max)
  
tibble(variable_name = names(dat), type = unname(types), no_of_na = 
         unname(navals), min = unname(mins), max = unname(maxs)) %>%
    left_join(dict %>% select(variable_name, definition), 
              by = "variable_name") %>%
    select(variable_name, definition, type, min, max, no_of_na)}

mdr_vars <- variables(mdr, dict)
tb_vars <- variables(tb, dict) 
ds_vars <- variables(ds, dict)
gdp_vars <- variables(gdp, dict) 
health_vars <- variables(health, dict)

# Important! Each dataset has a lot of variables, many of which I do not 
# use downstream. To conserve space in my final report, I am only showing the 
# information for the variables I use later on. 

mdr_toshow <- c("iso3","year","e_inc_rr_num")
tb_toshow <- c("iso3","year","g_whoregion","e_inc_100k","e_pop_num")
ds_toshow <- c("iso3","year","pulm_labconf_new","pulm_labconf_ret", 
               "r_rlt_new","r_rlt_ret","rr_new","rr_ret")
gdp_toshow <- c("iso3","year","GDPpc","Country")
health_toshow <- c("iso3","year","Healthpc","Country")

kable(mdr_vars %>% filter(variable_name %in% mdr_toshow), caption = 
        "Variables from Multi-Drug Resistance Dataset") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = FALSE)

kable(tb_vars %>% filter(variable_name %in% tb_toshow), caption = 
        "Variables from Tuberculosis Burden Dataset") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = FALSE)
  
kable(ds_vars %>% filter(variable_name %in% ds_toshow), caption = 
        "Variables from Data Surveillance Dataset") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = FALSE)

kable(gdp_vars %>% filter(variable_name %in% gdp_toshow), caption = 
        "Variables from GDP per Capita Dataset") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = FALSE)

kable(health_vars %>% filter(variable_name %in% health_toshow), caption = 
        "Variables from Healthcare Expenditure per Capita Dataset") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = FALSE)
```

These summaries makes it very clear that analyzing proportions instead
of raw counts is required because the denominators (r_rlt_x for example)
vary a lot.

As I was going through the variables and their definitions, I noticed
that there are some pitfalls to any analysis we try to achieve here.

The WHO and World Bank tables give us raw counts (number tested, number
resistant etcetera) and the context (GDP/Healthcare expenditure per
capita), but raw counts cannot be compared directly across countries or
years because:

1.  Different population sizes can have different TB burden (a country
    with more TB will naturally have more resistant cases, even if the
    proportion that are resistant are identical to a smaller country)
2.  Different testing intensity (countries with more well (established
    drug susceptibility testing (DST) will detect more resistance just
    because they looked more/harder. In other words, low testing can
    make resistance look low.
3.  Previously treated patients have higher resistance risk than new
    patients. So, a country testing more previously treated cases would
    look worse.

To make any further downstream analysis more fair (apples-to-apples), I
chose to summarize drug resistance as proportions and explicitly
quantify the coverage of testing, making the data less sensitive to
country size. For this, I created three new variables from the raw data:

1.  DST coverage: How many bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary TB
    cases per country per year received rifampicin?

    $DST Coverage = \frac{r-rlt-new + r-rlt-ret}{pulm-labconf-new + pulm-labconf-ret}$

2.  RR/MDR cases among new cases: The proportion of new
    bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary TB patients who were
    rifampicin resistant (MDR)

    $MDR Share New = \frac{rr-new}{r-rlt-new}$

3.  RR/MDR Share Overall = Proportion of MDR among all tested
    bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary TB cases (new or prev.
    treated). I use this to reflect the overall detected resistance
    burden in the tested population.

    $RRShareAll = \frac{rr-new + rr-ret}{r-rlt-new + r-rlt-ret}$

4.  MDR incidence per 100k = The estimated incidence of Multi Drug
    Resistance in a country-year per 100000 people

    $MDRInc100k = \frac{e-inc-rr-num}{e-pop-num}$

Next step- defining the new variables and creating a combined dataset.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

MDRData <- gdp %>%
  full_join(health %>% select(iso3, year, Healthpc), by = c("iso3","year")) %>%
  full_join(tb %>% select(iso3, year, g_whoregion, e_inc_100k, e_pop_num), by = 
              c("iso3","year")) %>%
  full_join(ds %>% select(iso3, year, pulm_labconf_new, pulm_labconf_ret, 
                          r_rlt_new, r_rlt_ret, rr_new, rr_ret), 
            by = c("iso3","year")) %>%
  full_join(mdr %>% select(iso3, year, e_inc_rr_num), 
            by = c("iso3", "year")) %>%
  mutate(DST_coverage = if_else((pulm_labconf_new + pulm_labconf_ret) > 0,
      (r_rlt_new + r_rlt_ret) / (pulm_labconf_new + pulm_labconf_ret), NA_real_),
    RR_share_new = if_else(r_rlt_new > 0, rr_new / r_rlt_new, NA_real_),
    RR_share_all = if_else((r_rlt_new + r_rlt_ret) > 0, 
                           (rr_new + rr_ret) / (r_rlt_new + r_rlt_ret), NA_real_), 
    mdr_inc_100k = if_else(!is.na(e_inc_rr_num) & !is.na(e_pop_num) & 
                             e_pop_num > 0, e_inc_rr_num / e_pop_num * 100000, 
                           NA_real_),
    coverage_more_than_80 = !is.na(DST_coverage) & DST_coverage >= 0.80)
```

Before visualizing the key variables, I want to confirm that the values
we are using are "normal", and not unexpected. For instance, proportions
need to be between 0-1, resistant cases cannot exceed tested cases,
tested cases cannot exceed lab-confirmed cases, and our main numeric
quantities cannot be negative.

```{r}
library(dplyr) 

# A proportion is impossible if it lies outside 0-1.
impossible_proportions <- MDRData %>%
  mutate(
    impossible_DST  = !is.na(DST_coverage) & !(DST_coverage >= 0 & 
                                                 DST_coverage <= 1),
    impossible_RRn  = !is.na(RR_share_new) & !(RR_share_new >= 0 & 
                                                 RR_share_new <= 1),
    impossible_RRa  = !is.na(RR_share_all) & !(RR_share_all >= 0 & 
                                                 RR_share_all <= 1)
  ) %>%
  filter(impossible_DST | impossible_RRn | impossible_RRa) %>%
  select(iso3, year, DST_coverage, RR_share_new, RR_share_all, 
         impossible_DST, impossible_RRn, impossible_RRa)

paste("The number of data entires with impossible proportions: ", 
      nrow(impossible_proportions))

# A relationship is illogical if the incidences are greater than 
# the the cases tested
illogical <- MDRData %>%
  transmute(
    iso3, year,
    rr_new_gt_tested  = rr_new  > r_rlt_new,
    rr_ret_gt_tested  = rr_ret  > r_rlt_ret,
    tested_gt_labconf = (r_rlt_new + r_rlt_ret) >
                        (pulm_labconf_new + pulm_labconf_ret)
  ) %>%
  filter(rr_new_gt_tested | rr_ret_gt_tested | tested_gt_labconf)

paste("The number of data entires with illogical counts: ", nrow(illogical))

# The key variables cannot be negative
negatives <- MDRData %>%
  select(iso3, year,
         pulm_labconf_new, pulm_labconf_ret,
         r_rlt_new, r_rlt_ret, rr_new, rr_ret,
         e_inc_100k, GDPpc, Healthpc) %>%
  filter(if_any(where(is.numeric), ~ .x < 0))

paste("The number of data entires with negative values for non-negative 
      variables: ", nrow(negatives))
```

To remove the "bad" data before plotting:

```{r}
library(tidyr)

# Removing the data that we defined as "bad" from the previous step
MDRData_clean <- MDRData %>%
  filter(
    is.na(DST_coverage) | (DST_coverage >= 0 & DST_coverage <= 1),
    is.na(RR_share_new) | (RR_share_new >= 0 & RR_share_new <= 1),
    is.na(RR_share_all) | (RR_share_all >= 0 & RR_share_all <= 1)
  ) %>%
  filter(
    !replace_na(rr_new  > r_rlt_new, FALSE),
    !replace_na(rr_ret  > r_rlt_ret, FALSE),
    !replace_na((r_rlt_new + r_rlt_ret) >
                (pulm_labconf_new + pulm_labconf_ret), FALSE)
  )

rows_removed = nrow(MDRData) - nrow(MDRData_clean)

paste("The number of rows removed: ", rows_removed)
```

Now that the data is cleaned, I can choose and plot my key variables:

DST_coverage, RR_share_new, RR_share_all, e_inc_100k, GDPpc and
Healthpc.

```{r}
library(dplyr)

data1 <- MDRData_clean %>%

                           levels = c("DST_coverage", "RR_share_new", 
                                      "RR_share_all"), 
                           labels = c("DST coverage", "RR share (new)", 
                                      "RR share (all)")))

data2 <- data1 %>%

data3 <- MDRData_clean %>%
  transmute('GDP per Capita (log10)' = log10(GDPpc),

```

Interpretations:

1.  DST Coverage is very right-skewed towards high-coverage (\>0.8),
    with a long left tail. This implies that many country-years have
    good rifampicin testing coverage, but some still lag far behind.
2.  RR Shares (new and all) are tightly concentrated near 0-10%, with a
    few extreme values near 1, which might be some small denominators
    (few tests leading to unstable proportions)
3.  After log transformation, GDP per capita and health expenditure per
    capita look roughly bell-shaped. TB incidence per 100k seems
    slightly skewed to the right even on the log scale, which shows that
    high TB burdens are fewer but far higher than the median.
4.  Most WHO regions contribute similarly to the share of MDR, with some
    obvious outliers like Europe.

Now, for the analysis:

## Map of (Latest) Tuberculosis Incidence per 100k

world_incidences <- worldmap %>% left_join(latest_incidence, by = "iso3")

#Defining my color palette
coloring <- colorBin("YlOrRd", domain = world_incidences$incidence_100k, bins = c(0,10,25,50,100,200,400,800), na.color = "white")

# Making an interactive world map

              opacity = 1, 
              fillOpacity = 0.85, 
              label = ~paste0(name_long, ifelse(is.na(incidence_100k), ": No Data Available", 
              paste0(": ", round(incidence_100k), " per 100k (", year, ")"))), 
              highlight = highlightOptions(weight = 2,

                title = "TB incidences per 100k", opacity = 0.9)
  
```

This map highlights persistent hotspots in parts of sub-Saharan Africa
and SE Asia, with lower incidences across most of Europe and North
America.

This graph describes the countries with the most change (top 50) in the
median MDR share between 2017 and 2023. Africa and the Americas showed
the most increase in MDR share between 2017 and 2023. Africa also had a
significant number of countries within the top 50 that showed a decrease
in MDR share. However, it is important to note that DST coverage is not
included here. It could be possible that countries have higher (or
lower) MDR TB reports just because they had high/low testing.

## GDP vs MDR Incidence per 100k

```{r}
library(scales) 

# Plotting MDR TB per 100k as a function of GDP per capita. I chose to scale by log10 for readability. 

ggplot(MDRData %>% filter(is.finite(log10(GDPpc)), is.finite(mdr_inc_100k)), 
       aes(x = log10(GDPpc), y = mdr_inc_100k, color = pmin(DST_coverage, 1))) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.25, size = 1) + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = TRUE, color = "black") + 
  scale_color_viridis_c(name = "DST coverage", labels = percent) + 
  scale_y_log10(labels = comma) + 
  labs(title = "Is higher GDP per capita associated with lower MDR TB incidence?", 
       x = "log 10(GDP per capita)", y = "MDR TB incidence per 100k (log scale)") + 
  theme_minimal()

```

## GDP vs MDR Incidence per 100k, filtered for DST Coverage

```{r}
library(scales) 

# Same plot as before but adding a DST >= 80% filter. 

ggplot(MDRData %>% filter(coverage_more_than_80, is.finite(log10(GDPpc)), 
                          !is.na(RR_share_all)), 
       aes(x = log10(GDPpc), y = RR_share_all)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.4, size = 1) + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = TRUE, color = "black") + 
  scale_y_continuous(labels = percent) + 
  labs(title = "GDP vs MDR Share Filtered for DST Coverage >= 80%", 
       x = "log10 (GDP per Capita)", 
       y = "MDR among those tested (proportion)") + 
  theme_minimal()
```

From both above graphs: There is a clear negative relationship. As GDP
per capita increases, estimated MDR incidence per 100k falls. Using log
scale on both axes stabilizes the variance and shows that this pattern
holds across several magnitude orders in income and incidence. Most
countries seem to have DST coverage \> 50%.

## Healthcare Expenditure vs MDR Incidence per 100k

```{r}
library(scales) 

# Plotting MDR TB incidence per 100k as a function of healthcare expenditure per country. 

ggplot(MDRData %>% filter(is.finite(log10(Healthpc)), is.finite(mdr_inc_100k)), 
       aes(x = log10(Healthpc), y = mdr_inc_100k, color = pmin(DST_coverage, 1))) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.25, size = 1) + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = TRUE, color = "black") + 
  scale_color_viridis_c(name = "DST coverage", labels = percent) + 
  scale_y_log10(labels = comma) + 
  labs(title = "Is higher healthcare expenditure per capita associated with lower MDR TB incidence?", 
       x = "log 10(Healthcare Expenditure per capita)", y = "MDR TB incidence per 100k (log scale)") + 
  theme_minimal()
```

## Healthcare Expenditure vs MDR Incidence per 100k, filtered for DST coverage

```{r}
library(scales) 

# Same plot as above but filtering to DST >= 80%

ggplot(MDRData %>% filter(coverage_more_than_80, is.finite(log10(Healthpc)), !is.na(RR_share_all)), 
       aes(x = log10(Healthpc), y = RR_share_all)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.4, size = 1) + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = TRUE, color = "black") + 
  scale_y_continuous(labels = percent) + 
  labs(title = "Healthcare Expenditure vs MDR Share Filtered for DST Coverage >= 80%", 
       x = "log10 (Healthcare Expenditure per Capita)", 
       y = "MDR among those tested (proportion)") + 
  theme_minimal()
```

The graphs (and DST coverage) mirror the GDP relationship. Higher
per-capita health spending aligns with lower MDR incidence per 100k.
While this is definitely not causal, the gradient is consistent with the
idea that systems with better resources not only detect, but also
prevent and treat drug resistance more effectively.

## Summary Statistics

library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)

d1 <- MDRData %>% filter(is.finite(log10(GDPpc)), is.finite(log10(mdr_inc_100k))) %>% 
  transmute(x = log10(GDPpc), y = log10(mdr_inc_100k))
rho1 <- if (nrow(d1) > 1) cor(d1$x, d1$y, method = "spearman") else NA_real_

d2 <- MDRData %>% filter(coverage_more_than_80, is.finite(log10(GDPpc)), !is.na(RR_share_all)) %>% 
  transmute(x = log10(GDPpc), y = RR_share_all)
rho2 <- if (nrow(d2) > 1) cor(d2$x, d2$y, method = "spearman") else NA_real_

stats_table <- tibble::tibble("Comparison" = c("log10(GDP per Capita) vs log10(MDR incidence per 100k)", "log10(GDP per Capita) vs MDR share (DST ≥80%)"), "Spearman 𝛠"= c(rho1, rho2))

kable(stats_table, digits = 3, caption = "Associations between GDP Per Capita and MDR burden (2017–2023)") %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = FALSE)

d3 <- MDRData %>% filter(is.finite(log10(Healthpc)), is.finite(log10(mdr_inc_100k))) %>% 
  transmute(x = log10(Healthpc), y = log10(mdr_inc_100k))
rho1 <- if (nrow(d3) > 1) cor(d3$x, d3$y, method = "spearman") else NA_real_

d4 <- MDRData %>% filter(coverage_more_than_80, is.finite(log10(Healthpc)), !is.na(RR_share_all)) %>% transmute(x = log10(Healthpc), y = RR_share_all)
rho2 <- if (nrow(d4) > 1) cor(d4$x, d4$y, method = "spearman") else NA_real_

stats_table <- tibble::tibble("Comparison" = c("log10(Health. Exp. Per Capita) vs log10(MDR incidence per 100k)", "log10(Health. Exp. Per Capita) vs MDR share (DST ≥80%)"), "Spearman 𝛠"= c(rho1, rho2))

kable(stats_table, digits = 3, caption = "Associations between Healthcare Expenditure and MDR burden (2017–2023)") %>% kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = FALSE)
```

Spearman correlation between log10 GDPpc and log10 MDR incidence per
100k is moderately negative at -0.56, and between log10 Healthpc and
log10 MDR incidence per 100k is similar. The correlation gets weaker
when DST is used to restrict the data, which I would expect because the
share of MDR incidence depends on who is tested even when the coverage
is high. Together, I would conclude that these results suggest income
and health spending tract absolute MDR burden rather than the proportion
among those who were tested.

# Conclusion 

Across 2017–2023, ***countries with greater economic resources and
higher per-capita health spending tend to have lower MDR/RR-TB incidence
per 100k***, and (to a lesser extent) lower MDR shares among those
tested.

These patterns persist after removing implausible records and, for
shares, focusing on settings with high DST coverage. The consistency
(while NOT causal) across multiple plots (distributions, map, gradients,
correlations) supports the hypothesis that stronger finances are
accompanied by reduced MDR burden, possibly via prevention, earlier
diagnosis, and more effective treatment programs.
